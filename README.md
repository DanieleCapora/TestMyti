I used Eclipse as my Java development environment. I used java 8 with respective jdk version 1.8.0_202.\
I uploaded the executable jar files for the first and second exercise as well as the respective class packs.\
The third exercise I was able to create a local server with Eclipse but I could not get it to work for the methods I need. I still load the .java classes.
